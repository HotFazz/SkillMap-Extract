    "general_description": "**Module M2: Intermediate Java Programming and Object-Oriented Principles** **General Description:** This module builds upon the foundational skills acquired in Module M1, delving deeper into the principles of Java programming with a focus on object-oriented design. Students will learn how to design Java classes, add instance fields, and create constructor methods. The module will also cover the creation and use of getters and setters, the use of the dot operator, printing to the terminal, and the concept of scope or variable shadowing. 1. **Designing Java Classes**",
