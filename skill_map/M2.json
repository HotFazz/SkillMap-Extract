    "general_description": "### Module M2: Building Java Classes and Understanding Scope #### General Description This module builds upon the foundational skills acquired in Module M1, focusing on the design and implementation of Java classes. Students will learn to create well-structured Java classes with fields, constructors, and methods. They will also explore the concept of scope and variable shadowing, which are crucial for writing clear and maintainable code. By the end of this module, students will be able to design and implement simple Java applications and understand the importance of encapsulation and data manipulation within classes. --- ### Skill Map #### 1. Designing Java Classes Learn the principles of object-oriented design and how to implement them in Java.",
