    "general_description": "**Module M3: Advanced Java Programming and GitHub Collaboration** **General Description:** This module extends the knowledge gained in the previous modules, focusing on advanced Java programming concepts and collaboration using GitHub. Students will learn about arrays, loops, exception handling, and file I/O in Java. They will also explore the use of GitHub for collaborative projects, including branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. 1. **Understanding and Using Arrays in Java**",
