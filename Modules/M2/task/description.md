# Hello, INDA!

Welcome to the first assignment for DD1337!



### ‚úÖ Learning Goals
This week's learning goals include:
  
* How to get help in this programming course
* Creating your first Java program
* Compiling and executing a Java Program
* Making a Java class from scratch
* Using methods in Java
* Basic Github proficiency 


### üèõ Assignment

*First things first, make sure you clone your repo to your local file system!* Here's a [quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_oFmi_jA0A) on what that means.

Also, we have arranged the exercises using emojis:

| Emoji      | Description |
| :-------: | ----------- |
| üìö | Complementary reading. If you see this emoji, you will find introductions to new concepts or explanations that will be useful for the current exercise.  |
| üõ†  | Working example. In some exercises we give you working example code that you can use in your programs. |

#### Exercise 0.1 -- Code of Conduct

In the [`docs`](docs) folder you have a template called `README.md`. Please submit answers to the questions in that document! Use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to *prettify* your submission!

#### Exercise 0.2 -- üéµ Help, I need somebody üé∂
Beginning programmers like yourself are most likely to have a load of questions. Under the üö® **Troubleshooting Guide**, you will find some official channels where you can get help! To pass this exercise, you must open a new issue (as explained in the üö® **Troubleshooting Guide**) with a question for this exercise!

> **Assistant's note:** If you can't think of any relevant questions, just open an issue with the title "Task 1: My first issue".

#### Exercise 1.1 -- Hello, World!
In the [`src`](src) folder, create a file called `HelloWorld.java`. 
Following the example code in the OLI-material, produce a `Hello World`-program!

<details>
<summary> üõ† How to compile your program </summary>
<br>
To run your program, type the following in your terminal:

```
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```
If you need help, follow the üö® **Troubleshooting Guide** at the top of this document!
</details>

#### Exercise 1.2 -- `Arithmetic.java`
Create another file in `src` called `Arithmetic.java`.
Your next task will be to create some methods in this Java class
for performing basic arihmetic operations.

#### Exercise 1.3 -- Sum
Create a method called `sum` that takes two arguments of type `int` and returns their sum as an `int`.
The _method header_ should be:
```java
public int sum(int a, int b)
````

<details>
<summary> üõ† Add a main method to your program</summary>

To test your methods, you must add a `main` method. Add the following code to bottom of your `Arithmetic` class:
  
  ```Java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create a new Arithmetic object
    Arithmetic arithmetic = new Arithmetic();

    // store the sum of 3 and 5 in a variable called "test"
    int test = arithmetic.sum(3, 5);

    // print the test variable
    System.out.println("The value of 3 + 5 is:");
    System.out.println(test);
}
  ```
</details>

<details>
<summary> üìö ... main method? </summary>

This early on in your programming career, the main method might appear as foul magic. For now, you need to know that it is required for your program to execute a sequence of commands. Oracle, the company behind Java, has a [tutorial explaining the main method](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/application/index.html#MAIN). It is quite a read, and we do not expect you to fully understand the *why* and *how* just yet. 

Put the main method at the bottom of your Java class:

```java
public class Arithmetic {
  
  // define your methods here!
  
  // put your main method here!
  public static void main(String[] args){
  
    // sequence of commands
    
  } // END OF MAIN METHOD

} // END OF CLASS
```

</details>

#### Exercise 1.4 -- Difference
Create a  method called `difference` that returns the *difference* between two integers, that is, `difference(2, 5)` should return `-3` (_2 - 5_).
The method header should be:
```java
public int difference(int a, int b)
```

#### Exercise 1.5 -- Average
Create a method called `average` that takes two `double`s as arguments and returns their arithmetic average. For example, if you call `average(3.0, 4.0)`, you should get the result `3.5`.
The method header should be:
```java
public double average(double a, double b)
```

> **Assistant's note:** Note that the header of `average` differs from the two previous methods - its parameters are `double`s, not `int`s, and its return type should be a `double`.

#### Exercise 1.6 -- don't forget to `git`!

When you are done with your assignment, you must push it to your repository on Github. 
If you don't do this, any changes you have made will only be present on your local machine
and your TA will not be able to grade your assignment. If you are uncertain how to
push your files, we have provided you with a brief walktrough.

<details>
<summary> üõ† How to push your solution to Github when you are done </summary>

When you are done with your assignment, you must push it to Github. You can either use the terminal in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics) 
or use the stand-alone terminal in your operating system.

You must navigate to your assignment folder by using the change directory command `cd`.

First, you must *add* the files that you want to commit. You should have modified the following files:

* `src/Arithmetic.java`
* `src/HelloWorld.java` 
* `docs/README.md`

```bash
# You can add more than one file at a time
git add src/Arithmetic.java src/HelloWorld.java docs/README.md
```

Then, after adding the files, you must *commit* these files with a message:

```bash
# The -m is called a flag, and is short for 'message'
git commit -m "Done with my first assignment"
```
If you forget to add the `-m` flag, you will be redirected to the text editor [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)),
where you can enter a longer commit message.
Using Vim can be a bit tricky, so unless you want to try to enter your commit message using Vim you
can abort your commit by typing `:q!` (you may need to press the `Esc` key first) and pressing `enter`.
You must then commit again (and don't forget `-m`!). 

Finally, you *push* the committed files to Github:

```bash
git push
```

You should get a response from `git` telling you everything is fine. Go to your repository and 
make sure that you can see your changes to the files. Otherwise, follow the steps in üö® **Troubleshooting Guide**.
